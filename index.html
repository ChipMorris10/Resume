    <h4>Ski Trax</h4>
    <p>Track your days on the slopes</p>
    <a href="https://skitrax.herokuapp.com/#/">Check it out!</a>
    <p>This was my final project. I incorporated wireframes/mock-ups, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and AngularJS. By building on my experience with my first project, I spent almost three full days thinking about what I wanted to do and how I wanted the final outcome to look and be presented. As a result, I was able to make changes as I went along without causing too much stress. This was the first time I took UX into account.</p>

    <h4>My Coding Hours</h4>
    <p>My first project&ndash;presented during Week 10</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/ChipMorris10/Chip-s-Personal-Project">Look at the Github link</a>
    <p>Completed in just one week, I learned a lot working on this. My giggest learning: Be prepared to change. Because this was my first project and we only had one week to work on it, I didn't think the design and layout through very well and I had to make a number of changes on the fly. I Used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

    <h4>WordPress Site</h4>
    <p>I customized a Theme, overwriting some of their original layout.  This was my first attempt at working with WordPress.</p>
